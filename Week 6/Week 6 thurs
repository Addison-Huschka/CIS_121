my_sentence = '''Throughout all four years of high school, I was involved in student government. I applied as a freshman in the 
fall of 2021. I knew many people who were also applying for student government. There were no elections, just a small entrance 
assignment to show our commitment. Immediately, I was placed on a homecoming planning committee. I had no idea what was happening, 
but I quickly realized this was for me. Later that year, I took on my own fundraising project. All of the 9th and 10th grades 
participated in a fundraising competition, and I helped the school raise over two thousand dollars. This was the biggest thing I 
did, and I was a freshman at the time. I repeated this project and led other similar initiatives throughout my high school years. 
I also did a lot of volunteer work and community projects. Student government as a whole had 60-80 people in it every year I was 
there. I served on the cabinet all four years, which consisted of the people responsible for planning under the executive board. 
I was never at the top of the ladder, but I put in just as much effort and gained valuable leadership experience. Through this 
experience, I learned a lot about working in a team, planning events, and being someone others look to. We were divided into 
committees that organized different events. I was only the leader of a committee a few times, but I worked closely with the group. 
We had to brainstorm ideas for our projects, and sometimes it was challenging to coordinate the plan. I’ve realized I prefer 
working alone, but in student government, I had to collaborate with others. We designed setups and plans for homecoming and other 
events, and we always completed them. I also learned how to plan many events. Our homecoming and winter fundraiser were the biggest, 
with many individual projects involved. I know how to allocate funds for supplies and turn plans into reality. I’ve called places 
for donations and searched for the cheapest options on Amazon countless times. I felt most like a leader when people asked for my 
help. Because I was in student government and many knew it, I was asked about many different things. Younger members asked for 
assistance with their projects, and people outside the group asked about events or for help hanging signs for their clubs. I felt 
very recognized, and it made me feel like a true leader. I had to stay informed about what was happening, especially in the fall 
semester. I aimed to be someone others could go to for help, and I believe I achieved that. I’m proud to have been part of this 
group and look forward to applying what I’ve learned in the future. This experience taught me many skills, including valuable 
lessons I can apply in the future. I can demonstrate to employers that I was able to accomplish these things while still in high 
school. My leadership skills will serve me well in the workplace and in any future leadership roles or activities. I can 
brainstorm effectively in a group, even though it’s not my favorite, which is very important for my potential career paths. I can 
also use this leadership knowledge in college, such as joining the student government at MSU or other club councils. Additionally, 
I have the skills to start my own club if I choose. All of these opportunities are possible because I was part of Century High 
School’s Student Government.'''
