'''3 start paths 
    -Save the Princess
        You're a noble of the land (country) and all of the nobles are meeting in the castle for their annual meeting. You notice that someone isn't here, do you speak up or wait to see if someone else notices?
            speak up- You speak up, "Everyone! One of the many that gather here is missing." Everyone looks around and someone yells, "They're right! Princess (name) is missing!" Everyone starts noticing and asking where she is. You see someone rush out and everyone is talking to each other now about how she shouldn't be late like this. 
            wait- You don't say anything and get on with the meeting. You are more and more anxious because you notice the princess is the one missing. No one else says anthing and the meeting ends after some time. Before you head back to your estate, you ask someone where she is. "Oh! I'm not sure, she may have returned to her room," they say. You go into the palace and to her room. It is locked so you knock. Someone comes and opens the door. It is one of the maids and she is crying.
